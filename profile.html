                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>I am a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for understanding how massive systems communicate. My path took a major turn when I completed a <b>16-week 5G Communication & Technology certification</b> (Cultus/TNSDC), which opened my eyes to the world of disaggregated RAN and Core networks.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I believe that technology is a tool for social good. Whether I am deploying a private 5G core or building a <b>Travel Portal for the Disabled</b>, my goal is to create systems that are reliable, high-performing, and inclusive.</p>

                <h3>Technical Values</h3>
                <p>I am a firm believer in the <b>Ubuntu Linux ecosystem</b>. I prefer working in command-line environments where I can manage configurations directly. I am currently deepening my knowledge in <b>Cloud-Native systems</b> to understand the future of IoT and C-V2X.</p>

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>Outside of networking, I focus on <b>Web Accessibility (WCAG)</b>. I want to ensure the future of the web is accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical abilities.</p>
